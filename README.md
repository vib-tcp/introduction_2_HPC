## General context

Welcome to our **Introduction to HPC** VIB workshop! We are very happy to have you here.

This is the 2nd edition of this workshop

The half day session aims to introduce the different options available withing the Flemish system, while enabling students to quickly adapt to any HPC system they might access around the globe. With some best practices and differences and similarities within each system.

The **presentation** which goes alongside this material can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J6qROZ35JVeKpVx8TAjWNtbsjescx95ZtqbBCV8vYrg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Proposed Schedule

Half day Schedule:

- 13:00 - 13:30 - Introduction
- 13:30 - 15:00 - Accessing in the terminal and OnDemand
- 15:00 - 15:15 - Coffee Break
- 15:15 - 16:00 - Interactive sessions (debug and testing)
- 16:00 - 16:30 - Querying and using modules in the HPC
